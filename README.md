# Domestic Electricity Usage Prediction

The codes for my final project at Dibimbing.id Data Science Bootcamp

## Objective

The main purpose of this project is to see if weather affects domestic electricity usage.
The data is from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Appliances+energy+prediction.

## Gained Insight

Temperature and humidity affects electricity usage

## What next?

Further development is required before the model can be used to accurately predict electricity usage.
